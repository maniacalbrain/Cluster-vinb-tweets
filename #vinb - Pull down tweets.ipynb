    "The following code connects to a twitter account and pulls down all tweets sent using #vinb on the evening of Wednesday 24th of June 2015. The line \"from keys import keys\" in the first block refers to a file called keys.py that holds a dictionary called keys. This is used for the OAuth and has not been included in the repository. As the name suggests, the consumer secret and access token secret should be kept secret. Check the <a href=\"http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.2.0/\">documentation</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy\">Tweepy</a> for details on authenticating and searching Twitter using your own account."
