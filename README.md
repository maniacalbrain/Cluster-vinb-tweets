# The Cluster of Kerry
On the 22cd of June 2015 tv3 recorded an episode of the People's Debate with Vincent Browne at the Gleneagle in Killarney. The show was broadcast the following Wednesday.

I pulled down all tweets sent during the broadcast of the show which contained #vinb (#vinb - Pull down tweets.ipynb), created a graph of the total tweets and tweets containing specific keywords (#vinb - Tweets Graph.ipynb) and tried some basic clustering on the tweets (#vinb - Cluster Tweets.ipynb).
